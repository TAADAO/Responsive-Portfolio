            <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Robert Omohundro, and I am from Lubbock, Texas.
                I have lived in Lawrence, KS for the last 10 years. I have been married to my wife Aimee for
                the last 10 years, and we have two kids, two cats, and two dogs.</p>
            <p> My hobbies include raising my kids, playing video games, being active,
                and spending time with family and friends. I hope to add coding as a hobby
                as well. </p>
            <p> One thing I've learned in this class is that it is going to take a lot of grinding before
                you see the results you want. But if you don't grind, you don't shine.</p>
